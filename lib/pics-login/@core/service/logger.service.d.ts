/**
 * Simple logger system with the possibility of registering custom outputs.
 *
 * 4 different log levels are provided, with corresponding methods:
 * - debug   : for debug information
 * - info    : for informative status of the application (success, ...)
 * - warning : for non-critical errors that do not prevent normal application behavior
 * - error   : for critical errors that prevent normal application behavior
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```
 * import { Logger } from 'app/core/logger.service';
 *
 * const log = new Logger('myFile');
 * ...
 * log.debug('something happened');
 * ```
 *
 * To disable debug and info logs in production, add this snippet to your root component:
 * ```
 * export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
 *   ngOnInit() {
 *     if (environment.production) {
 *       Logger.enableProductionMode();
 *     }
 *     ...
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * If you want to process logs through other outputs than console, you can add LogOutput functions to Logger.outputs.
